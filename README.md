scikit-learn
============

This repository contains my explorations in the scikit-learn package.

Scikit-learn package
--------------------

1. Classification  
2. Regression  
3. Clustering     
4. Dimensionality reduction    
5. Model selection    
6. Pre-processing   
  
In particular, we explore:  
* branching data sets into test and train subsets 
* [perceptron](https://github.com/FyzHsn/scikit-exploration/blob/master/Scikit_Script_Perceptron.py)     
* modeling class logictic regression (not related to regression analysis) allowing us to attach probability/confidence to prediction  
* regularization to prevent overfitting of data  
* maximum margin classification with support vector machines (SVM)    
* dealing with nonlinearly separable case using slack variables and kernel SVM  
* decision tree learning and maximizing  information gain  
* combining weak to strong learners via random forests  
* K-nearest neighbors
